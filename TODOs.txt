TODO:

--- PLAYER

- Make Player speed independent from frame rate
- Make Player speed dependent from y-position in window (the "further away" from screen, the slower the movement)



--- ROOMS / WORLD

- find a proper place to store NavMesh info inside/along the rooms
- come up with a way to organize all rooms in the world
- ?dynamic reordering? of draw calls to be able to use objects inside rooms, that overlap the player when at certain y-position and above



--- PATH FINDING

-- General
- build function to check whether two line segments intersect
- build function to check whether a point lies inside a polygon

-- Algorithms
- Implement A-star or Dijkstra's algorithm for the node-graph of the NavMesh. This will preselect the polygons to perform the next algorithm
- Get list of portals between the polygons, that A-star or Dijkstra outputs
- SSF (Simple Stupid Funnel) algorithm to create the actual path across the portals to the target position
    (Using convex polygons exclusively will guarantee that the portals associated with a polygon can always be reached from anywhere inside of the polygon)
