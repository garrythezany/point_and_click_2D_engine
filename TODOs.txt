TODO:

--- PLAYER
- Make Player speed independent from frame rate
- Make Player speed dependent from y-position in window (the "further away" from screen, the slower the movement)

--- ROOMS / WORLD
- find a proper place to store NavMesh info inside/along the rooms
- come up with a way to organize all rooms in the world

--- PATH FINDING
- Implement A-star or Dijkstra's algorithm for the node-graph of the NavMesh. This will preselect the polygons to perform the next algorithm
- Get list of portals between the polygons, that A-star or Dijkstra outputs
- SSF (Simple Stupid Funnel) algorithm to create the actual path across the portals to the target position
